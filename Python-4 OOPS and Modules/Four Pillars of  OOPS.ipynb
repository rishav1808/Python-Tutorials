    "It is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and the user is presented with the most essential variables. The need not to worry about how a method works and only to use the method .Ex: Using the button of TVs and not thinking how that  button is actually working\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Encapsulation\n",
    "It is similar to Abstraction.This is a programming style where implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "The main difference is that Encapsulation is done for the purpose of SECURITY.\n",
