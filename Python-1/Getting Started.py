''' There are Two types of Programming Languages
    1.Compiled Language: The language where the source code file is converted to an executable file(.exe) which basically contains machine level code(Binary)
                         Ex:C++
    2.Interpreted Language:where the source code is read by an Interpreter Line-by-Line and executed on the machine
                            Even though there is some error but still the lines above the error line will run fine.
                            Ex:Python
                            Python Virtual Machine acts as Interpreter and reads the source code line by line

    
 '''
print("Hi Rishav")
print("Welcome")
#Now error will occur but the above line will work perfectly
print(20/0)
#To open Jupyter Notebook, in the desired location open the cmd and enter 'jupyter-notebook'
